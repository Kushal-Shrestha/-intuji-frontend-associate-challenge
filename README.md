### Project Overview

This project implements the "FInance Dashboard" design from the provided Figma file to a responsive HTML/CSS and Javascript webpage. It serves as a dashboard with an overview, analytics chart, saving plan, and recent transactions. The goal is to closely match the Figma design while following the best practices for structure, responsiveness, and maintainable code.
